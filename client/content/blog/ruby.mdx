Welcome to the first tutorial in our series on building a landing page with Ruby on Rails. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a basic landing page using Ruby on Rails.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, you'll need to have the following:

- Ruby 2.6.3 or higher installed on your computer
- The Rails gem installed on your computer (you can install it using `gem install rails`)
- A text editor (we recommend using VS Code)

## Step 1: Create a new Rails app

To get started, we'll create a new Rails app. Open up your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
rails new landing-page
```

This will create a new Rails app called `landing-page` in the current directory. Next, we'll navigate into the `landing-page` directory and start the Rails server:

```bash

cd landing-page

rails server

```

This will start the Rails server on port 3000. You can now visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view your new Rails app.

## Step 2: Create a new controller

Now that we have our Rails app set up, we can start creating our landing page. To do this, we'll create a new controller called `PagesController`. Run the following command to create the controller:

```bash

rails generate controller Pages

```

This will create a new controller called `PagesController` in the `app/controllers` directory. Next, we'll add a new action called `home` to the `PagesController`:

```ruby

class PagesController < ApplicationController

def home

end

end

```

This will create a new action called `home` in the `PagesController`. Next, we'll add a new route to the `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby

Rails.application.routes.draw do

root 'pages#home'

end

```

This will set the `root` route to the `home` action in the `PagesController`. Now, if you visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, you should see the following message:

```text

Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!

```

## Step 3: Create a new view

Now that we have our controller set up, we can start creating our landing page. To do this, we'll create a new view called `home.html.erb` in the `app/views/pages` directory. Open up the `home.html.erb` file and add the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Landing Page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

This will create a basic HTML page with a heading that says "Hello, World!". Now, if you visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, you should see the following message:

```text

Hello, World!

```

## Step 4: Add some CSS

Now that we have our landing page set up, we can start adding some CSS. To do this, we'll create a new file called `application.css` in the `app/assets/stylesheets` directory. Open up the `application.css` file and add the following CSS:

```css
body {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}
```

This will set the background color of the body to `#f5f5f5`. Now, if you visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, you should see the following message:

```text

Hello, World!

```

## Step 5: Add some JavaScript

Now that we have our landing page set up, we can start adding some JavaScript. To do this, we'll create a new file called `application.js` in the `app/assets/javascripts` directory. Open up the `application.js` file and add the following JavaScript:

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

This will log the message "Hello, World!" to the console. Now, if you visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, you should see the following message:

```text

Hello, World!

```
