This is Scalerepo's first changelog and what better feature to introduce than the changelog itself!
Over the last couple of weeks, we've quietly introduced a MDX rendering engine that's now powering our [blog](/blog), [docs](/docs), and now this changelog.

One of the most jarring experiences in many websites is when you're switching between multiple providers for a blog, changelog, and documentation. Each provider has its own style and uses a different datastore which leads to obvious issues with data quality and aesthetics.
With Scalerepo, you'll be able to write all three of these sites in MDX in the same repo as your codebase.

To add a new changelog entry, create a file in `/content/changelog/`, with the format `date-your-title.mdx`

The first few lines of this MDX file is some self explanatory metadata and the rest of the file is regular MDX.

Note that the `author` field refers to an mdx file in `content/authors`. The same authors can write both blog posts and changelog entries.
